## General Information
An algorithm that draws Koch's curve using recursion. There is literally nothing more to it other than that. It simply makes for a fun side project that even uses a bit of math knowledge!

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.6+
- Pygame 2.0

## Setup
- First you need to have Python installed, at least version 3.6
- You will also need to have Pygame installed, I used version 2.0, but honestly, any should do
- If you dont know how to install Pygame you can open your console and type in `pip install pygame`. After that it should be succesfully installed and ready to use
- Next you can simply clone the repository by running `git clone <REPOSITORY>` command
- After that you should be done with whole repository cloned on your local machine

## Launch and Editing
- Inside you will find two files: main.py and calc_util.py
- Main.py is the main file. You want to run it through console - `python main.py` or use IDE, whatever is more to your liking
- You can also modify how the program behaves. After opening main.py near the top you will notice some variables all in caps. Most of them are labeled so it should be easy to find your way around

## Project Status
Project is complete. I do not think I will add or change anything in it. I am happy with the results. I might add something more but it depends if that will result in learning something new, or learrning how to make things better.

## Room for Improvement
There are few things that could be done better and it mostly involves the algorithm itself.
- Less repetetive way of recursively calling algorithm, a loop maybe
- It should start with a straight line rather than a triangle on a line already
- Maybe logic calculating the angles at which lines should be drawn could be optimized slightly
